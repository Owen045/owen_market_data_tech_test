# Performance & Scalability Analysis

## Current Implementation Overview

This API is built with FastAPI and uses an in-memory data store for rapid development. The current implementation prioritizes simplicity and clarity over production-grade scalability.

## Performance Considerations

### Current Bottlenecks

1. **In-Memory Data Storage**
   - All market and property data is loaded into memory at startup
   - For the current dataset (~12 properties, 3 markets, 9 months of history): negligible impact
   - **Impact at scale**: With 1000+ properties, memory usage from json loading, plus additional overhead for Python objects could balloon and become untenable

2. **Linear Search Operations**
   - Property filtering in `get_market_properties` uses list comprehension: O(n) complexity
   - Sorting operations: most likely O(n log n) complexity - haven't examined python source code
   - **Impact at scale**: For 1000 properties in a single market, response times would also increase in line with memory usage

3. **No Caching Layer**
   - Market benchmarks are recalculated on every request
   - Variance calculations are performed real-time
   - **Impact at scale**: With frequent requests for popular markets, redundant calculations waste CPU cycles

4. **Synchronous I/O**
   - JSON file loading at startup blocks application initialization
   - **Impact**: Minimal for current data, but would increase with larger datasets to add to latency

### Memory Usage - Estimates

**Current State (12 properties, 3 markets):**
- Raw data: ~15 KB
- Python objects: ~1-2 MB (Pydantic model overhead)
- Peak memory during request: ~5-10 MB

**Projected at Scale (1000 properties, 50 markets):**
- Raw data: ~1.25 MB
- Python objects: ~50-100 MB
- Peak memory: ~150-250 MB per worker process

### Response Time Analysis

**Current benchmarks (estimated):**
- Market overview: <10ms
- Property performance: <15ms
- Market properties (10 results): <20ms
- Market properties (100 results, sorted): <50ms

**Projected at scale (1000 properties):**
- Market overview: <20ms (minimal change)
- Property performance: <25ms (minimal change)
- Market properties (10 results): 100-150ms (filtering overhead)
- Market properties (100 results, sorted): 200-300ms (sorting + filtering)

## Scalability Enhancements

### Database Design for Production

**Recommended: PostgreSQL with time-series optimization**

#### Schema Design

```sql
-- Markets table
CREATE TABLE markets (
    market_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    market_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    city VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    state VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    market_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Market performance (time-series data)
CREATE TABLE market_performance (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    market_id INT REFERENCES markets(market_id),
    performance_date DATE NOT NULL,
    avg_rent_per_sqft DECIMAL(10, 2),
    avg_occupancy_rate DECIMAL(5, 2),
    renewal_rate DECIMAL(5, 2),
    new_deal_rate DECIMAL(5, 2),
    avg_lease_term_months INT,
    avg_time_to_lease_days INT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(market_id, performance_date)
);

-- Properties table
CREATE TABLE properties (
    property_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    address TEXT,
    market_id INT REFERENCES markets(market_id),
    area_sqft INT,
    year_built INT,
    property_class VARCHAR(1),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Property performance (current snapshot)
CREATE TABLE property_performance (
    property_id INT PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES properties(property_id),
    current_occupancy_rate DECIMAL(5, 2),
    current_avg_rent_per_sqft DECIMAL(10, 2),
    renewal_rate_ytd DECIMAL(5, 2),
    avg_lease_term_months INT,
    avg_time_to_lease_days INT,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Property performance history (for trend analysis)
CREATE TABLE property_performance_history (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    property_id INT REFERENCES properties(property_id),
    performance_date DATE NOT NULL,
    occupancy_rate DECIMAL(5, 2),
    avg_rent_per_sqft DECIMAL(10, 2),
    renewal_rate DECIMAL(5, 2),
    lease_term_months INT,
    time_to_lease_days INT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(property_id, performance_date)
);
```

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Separation of current vs. historical data**: Optimizes for the common case (current performance) while maintaining history
2. **Denormalized performance tables**: Avoids joins for frequently accessed metrics
3. **Strategic indexing**: Highly advisable to add composite indexes on (market_id, date) for time-series queries
4. **DECIMAL types for financial data**: Avoids floating-point precision issues
5. **Partitioning strategy** (for >10M records): Partition `market_performance_history` by date range (monthly/quarterly)

### Caching Strategy

**Redis-based multi-layer caching:**

```python
# Layer 1: Market benchmark cache (TTL: 1 hour)
cache_key = f"market_benchmark:{market_id}:latest"
# Invalidate: when market data is updated

# Layer 2: Property performance summary (TTL: 30 minutes)
cache_key = f"property_summary:{property_id}"
# Invalidate: when property data is updated

# Layer 3: Market properties list (TTL: 15 minutes)
cache_key = f"market_properties:{market_id}:class_{class}:sort_{sort}"
# Invalidate: when any property in market is updated

# Layer 4: Computed analytics (TTL: 5 minutes)
cache_key = f"variance_analysis:{property_id}:{market_id}:{date}"
# Short TTL for frequently changing calculations
```

**Cache Invalidation Strategy:**
- Use Redis pub/sub for cache invalidation events
- Implement soft deletes with background recomputation
- Cache warming for popular markets during off-peak hours

## Future Enhancements

### Additional Analytical Capabilities

1. **Predictive Analytics**
   - ML models for rent price forecasting
   - Occupancy trend predictions based on seasonal patterns
   - Market cycle identification (expansion, peak, contraction, trough)

2. **Time-Series Analysis**
   - Rolling averages (30-day, 90-day, YTD)
   - Seasonal decomposition of performance metrics
   - Anomaly detection (sudden drops in occupancy, unusual rent changes)

### Integration with External Data Sources

1. **Economic Indicators**
   - National statistics (interest rates, employment)
   - Local employment stats
   - Correlation analysis between economic indicators and CRE performance

2. **Weather and Climate Data**
   - Impact of severe weather on property performance
   - Climate risk assessment for long-term investment decisions

3. **News and Sentiment Analysis**
   - News API for market-relevant events
   - Social media sentiment about neighborhoods/cities
   - Corporate relocation announcements affecting demand
