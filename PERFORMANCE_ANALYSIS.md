# Performance & Scalability Analysis

## Current Implementation Overview

This API is built with FastAPI and uses an in-memory data store for rapid development. The current implementation prioritizes simplicity and clarity over production-grade scalability.

## Performance Considerations

### Current Bottlenecks

1. **In-Memory Data Storage**
   - All market and property data is loaded into memory at startup
   - For the current dataset (~12 properties, 3 markets, 9 months of history): negligible impact
   - Memory usage: ~1-2 MB for current data
   - **Impact at scale**: With 1000+ properties, memory usage would grow to ~50-100 MB for data alone, plus additional overhead for Python objects

2. **Linear Search Operations**
   - Property filtering in `get_market_properties` uses list comprehension: O(n) complexity
   - Sorting operations: O(n log n) complexity
   - **Impact at scale**: For 1000 properties in a single market, response times would increase from <10ms to ~100-200ms

3. **No Caching Layer**
   - Market benchmarks are recalculated on every request
   - Variance calculations are performed real-time
   - **Impact at scale**: With frequent requests for popular markets, redundant calculations waste CPU cycles

4. **Synchronous I/O**
   - JSON file loading at startup blocks application initialization
   - **Impact**: Minimal for current data (~50ms), but would increase to several seconds with larger datasets

### Computational Complexity Analysis

| Operation | Current Complexity | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| Get market by ID | O(1) | Dictionary lookup |
| Get property by ID | O(1) | Dictionary lookup |
| Get market properties | O(n) | Linear scan of all properties |
| Calculate variance | O(1) | Simple arithmetic per metric |
| Property performance analysis | O(1) | Fixed 5 metrics per property |
| Market trends | O(k) | k = number of time periods (currently 9) |
| Sort/filter properties | O(n log n) | Standard sorting algorithms |
| Pagination | O(1) | Array slicing |

### Memory Usage

**Current State (12 properties, 3 markets):**
- Raw data: ~15 KB
- Python objects: ~1-2 MB (Pydantic model overhead)
- Peak memory during request: ~5-10 MB

**Projected at Scale (1000 properties, 50 markets):**
- Raw data: ~1.25 MB
- Python objects: ~50-100 MB
- Peak memory: ~150-250 MB per worker process

### Response Time Analysis

**Current benchmarks (estimated):**
- Market overview: <10ms
- Property performance: <15ms
- Market properties (10 results): <20ms
- Market properties (100 results, sorted): <50ms

**Projected at scale (1000 properties):**
- Market overview: <20ms (minimal change)
- Property performance: <25ms (minimal change)
- Market properties (10 results): 100-150ms (filtering overhead)
- Market properties (100 results, sorted): 200-300ms (sorting + filtering)

## Scalability Enhancements

### Database Design for Production

**Recommended: PostgreSQL with time-series optimization**

#### Schema Design

```sql
-- Markets table
CREATE TABLE markets (
    market_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    market_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    city VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    state VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    market_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_markets_city_state ON markets(city, state);
CREATE INDEX idx_markets_type ON markets(market_type);

-- Market performance (time-series data)
CREATE TABLE market_performance (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    market_id INT REFERENCES markets(market_id),
    performance_date DATE NOT NULL,
    avg_rent_per_sqft DECIMAL(10, 2),
    avg_occupancy_rate DECIMAL(5, 2),
    renewal_rate DECIMAL(5, 2),
    new_deal_rate DECIMAL(5, 2),
    avg_lease_term_months INT,
    avg_time_to_lease_days INT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(market_id, performance_date)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_market_perf_market_date ON market_performance(market_id, performance_date DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_market_perf_date ON market_performance(performance_date);

-- Properties table
CREATE TABLE properties (
    property_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    address TEXT,
    market_id INT REFERENCES markets(market_id),
    area_sqft INT,
    year_built INT,
    property_class VARCHAR(1),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_properties_market ON properties(market_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_properties_class ON properties(property_class);

-- Property performance (current snapshot)
CREATE TABLE property_performance (
    property_id INT PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES properties(property_id),
    current_occupancy_rate DECIMAL(5, 2),
    current_avg_rent_per_sqft DECIMAL(10, 2),
    renewal_rate_ytd DECIMAL(5, 2),
    avg_lease_term_months INT,
    avg_time_to_lease_days INT,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Property performance history (for trend analysis)
CREATE TABLE property_performance_history (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    property_id INT REFERENCES properties(property_id),
    performance_date DATE NOT NULL,
    occupancy_rate DECIMAL(5, 2),
    avg_rent_per_sqft DECIMAL(10, 2),
    renewal_rate DECIMAL(5, 2),
    lease_term_months INT,
    time_to_lease_days INT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(property_id, performance_date)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_prop_hist_property_date ON property_performance_history(property_id, performance_date DESC);
```

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Separation of current vs. historical data**: Optimizes for the common case (current performance) while maintaining history
2. **Denormalized performance tables**: Avoids joins for frequently accessed metrics
3. **Strategic indexing**: Composite indexes on (market_id, date) for time-series queries
4. **DECIMAL types for financial data**: Avoids floating-point precision issues
5. **Partitioning strategy** (for >10M records): Partition `market_performance_history` by date range (monthly/quarterly)

### Caching Strategy

**Redis-based multi-layer caching:**

```python
# Layer 1: Market benchmark cache (TTL: 1 hour)
cache_key = f"market_benchmark:{market_id}:latest"
# Invalidate: when market data is updated

# Layer 2: Property performance summary (TTL: 30 minutes)
cache_key = f"property_summary:{property_id}"
# Invalidate: when property data is updated

# Layer 3: Market properties list (TTL: 15 minutes)
cache_key = f"market_properties:{market_id}:class_{class}:sort_{sort}"
# Invalidate: when any property in market is updated

# Layer 4: Computed analytics (TTL: 5 minutes)
cache_key = f"variance_analysis:{property_id}:{market_id}:{date}"
# Short TTL for frequently changing calculations
```

**Cache Invalidation Strategy:**
- Use Redis pub/sub for cache invalidation events
- Implement soft deletes with background recomputation
- Cache warming for popular markets during off-peak hours

**Projected Impact:**
- Cache hit rate: 85-95% for popular markets
- Response time reduction: 60-80% for cached responses
- Database load reduction: 70-90%

### API Rate Limiting

**Implementation using Redis:**

```python
# Per-user rate limiting
# Tier 1 (free): 100 requests/minute
# Tier 2 (paid): 1000 requests/minute
# Tier 3 (enterprise): 10000 requests/minute

# Per-endpoint rate limiting
# /api/markets/{id}/properties: 60 requests/minute (expensive query)
# Other endpoints: 100 requests/minute
```

**Headers to include:**
```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 87
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1625097600
```

### Pagination Best Practices

**Current implementation**: Offset-based pagination
**Recommendation for scale**: Cursor-based pagination

```python
# Cursor-based pagination example
@router.get("/api/markets/{market_id}/properties")
def get_market_properties(
    market_id: int,
    cursor: Optional[str] = None,  # Encoded last property_id
    limit: int = 10
):
    # Decode cursor to get last_id
    last_id = decode_cursor(cursor) if cursor else 0

    # Query: WHERE property_id > last_id ORDER BY property_id LIMIT limit
    # More efficient for large result sets
```

**Benefits:**
- Consistent results even when data changes
- Better performance for deep pagination
- Prevents page drift issues

### Handling 1000+ Properties Across 50+ Markets

**Architectural recommendations:**

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Deploy multiple API instances behind a load balancer
   - Use sticky sessions for cursor-based pagination
   - Scale database with read replicas

2. **Query Optimization**
   - Pre-compute variance metrics nightly (batch job)
   - Store computed metrics in `property_analytics` table
   - Use materialized views for complex aggregations

3. **Background Processing**
   - Celery + Redis for async analytics calculations
   - Queue expensive operations (e.g., historical trend analysis)
   - Return 202 Accepted for long-running queries with callback URL

4. **Data Partitioning**
   - Partition by market_id for properties >100k
   - Time-based partitioning for performance_history
   - Use PostgreSQL table inheritance for efficient querying

   - Request throughput (requests/second)

2. **Business Metrics**
   - Most queried markets/properties
   - Feature usage (trend analysis vs. basic queries)
   - Data freshness (time since last update)

3. **Infrastructure Metrics**
   - Database connection pool utilization
   - Cache hit/miss rates
   - Memory and CPU usage per service

4. **Data Quality Metrics**
   - Percentage of properties with complete data
   - Data staleness (hours since last update)
   - Validation error rates

**Alerting Strategy:**
```
CRITICAL: P99 response time > 2 seconds for 5 minutes
WARNING: Cache hit rate < 70% for 15 minutes
INFO: Data not updated in last 24 hours
```

## Conclusion

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for the CRE Analytics API with clean architecture and proper separation of concerns. For production deployment at scale (1000+ properties, 50+ markets), the recommended approach is:

1. **Short-term (0-3 months)**: Implement Redis caching for performance improvements
2. **Medium-term (3-6 months)**: Migrate to PostgreSQL with optimized schema and indexes
3. **Long-term (6-12 months)**: Implement full observability stack, predictive analytics, and external integrations

The architecture is designed to scale incrementally, allowing for phased implementation based on user growth and feature requirements.
